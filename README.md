## ðŸ§  Project Overview
**Snow Crash** is a cybersecurity project from 42 School designed to introduce students to fundamental hacking techniques. Each level presents a unique challenge where the goal is to exploit system vulnerabilities to retrieve a password and access the next level.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Understand basic cybersecurity principles
- Discover vulnerabilities like:
  - File permission misconfigurations
  - Command injection
  - Binary exploitation
  - Privilege escalation
- Develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills
